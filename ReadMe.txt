Quartz Composer Application

Texture						An application that shows how to use the QCRenderer API to 
						render a Quartz composition into an OpenGL pBuffer, then 
						create a texture from it, and use the texture into another 
						OpenGL scene.

Sample Requirements				The project was created using the Xcode running under Mac OS 
						X 10.6.x or later.

About the sample				This sample asks the user to select a Quartz Composer 
						composition for rendering. The application uses two 
						rendering contexts. One context has the screen as the 
						rendering target, the other has a pbuffer as the rendering 
						target. Every time the rendering is triggered, a QCRenderer 
						with the selected composition renders the image result into 
						the pixel buffer. The image is then used as a texture in the 
						first context in an OpenGL quad.

Using the Sample				Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be found 
						in /Developer/Applications. Build the project and run.
